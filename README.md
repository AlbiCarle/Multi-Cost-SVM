# Multi-Cost-SVM (and Probabilistic Safety Regions for exponential distributions)

Multi Cost SVM (MC-SVM) is a variant of Support Vector Machines (SVM) designed to accommodate multiple cost scenarios. By introducing multiple weighting parameters $\tau$,  MC-SVM adapts the cost function to balance false positive and false negative errors, enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios. The result is a separation hyperplane indipendent from the sample probability of the data.

$$
\begin{align}
& &\underset{\mathbf{w}, \mathbf{c}, \boldsymbol{\xi}_1, \ldots, \boldsymbol{\xi}_n}{\text{minimize}} \frac{1}{2\eta} 
\mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{w} + \frac{1}{2} 
\end{align}
$$

### Key Features:
_Parameterized Cost Function_: MC-SVM incorporates a parameter $\tau$ to influence the cost function's behavior towards different types of errors. This parameterization allows to weight the SVMs with different weighting parameters, reducing the unbalanceness of the data and helping training a more robust algorithm.
_System of SVMs_: The algorithm constructs a system of $m$ SVMs using the same dataset but varying weights and offsets. Each SVM corresponds to a different value of $\tau$, enabling the model to adapt to various cost scenarios.

The optimization problem is solved in its dual form

Usage:
